"I like Chopin" is a very special MIDI player that uses Python 3, the Mido MIDI library, and Qt6. Any random key pressed on a physical MIDI piano or keyboard plays the correct note from the MIDI file. When all keys are released, the MIDI player stops. You need a physical MIDI keyboard connected to the computer.

Impress your friends with this musical magic trick!
