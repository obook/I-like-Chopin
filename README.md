"I like Chopin" is a very special MIDI player for Linux or Windows that uses Python 3, the Mido library and Qt6. Any random key pressed on a physical master keyboard plays the correct note from the MIDI file. When all keys are released, the MIDI player stops. You need a physical MIDI master keyboard connected to the computer and a virtual synthesizer.
